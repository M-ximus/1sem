That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
The source of this our watch and the chief head
With all my imperfections on my head:
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
It is offended.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Pale or red?
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
My lord, I did;
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
To what I shall unfold.
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
But to recover of us, by strong hand
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
Do, if it will not stand.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And each particular hair to stand on end,
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
And carriage of the article design'd,
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
It waves you to a more removed ground:
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Friends to this ground.
O God!
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Have you had quiet guard?
A sable silver'd.
My dread lord,
My good lord--
How is't, my noble lord?
Nor I, my lord.
Arm'd, my lord.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
There's no offence, my lord.
Where, my lord?
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Propose the oath, my lord.
What does this mean, my lord?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
We do, my lord.
You shall not go, my lord.
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
What news, my lord?
Do not, my lord.
I shall obey, my lord.
Upon my sword.
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
He.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
If it be,
But this eternal blazon must not be
Then saw you not his face?
As he in his particular act and place
Bernardo has my place.
A double blessing is a double grace,
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
To offer it the show of violence;
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The lists and full proportions, are all made
And recks not his own rede.
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Go on; I'll follow thee.
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
And prey on garbage.
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
The triumph of his pledge.
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
'Tis strange.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
'Tis very strange.
May sweep to my revenge.
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
These hands are not more like.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Nay, very pale.
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Sit down awhile;
Season your admiration for awhile
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Mark me.
Who is't that can inform me?
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
That if again this apparition come,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
My hour is almost come,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Of his affection to me.
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
And liegemen to the Dane.
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
To those of mine!
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
If there be any good thing to be done,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
The bell then beating one,--
'Tis gone!
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
To you alone.
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
You are the most immediate to our throne;
From top to toe?
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
But to my mind, though I am native here
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
That youth and observation copied there;
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
I would I had been there.
What, is Horatio there?
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
Who's there?
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
As if it some impartment did desire
For every man has business and desire,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
Think it no more;
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As;³\´(-why she, even she--
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,

Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
In obstinate condolement is a course
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The safety and health of this whole state;
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As of a father: for let the world take note,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
But he's an arrant knave.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
Before my God, I might not this believe
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I think it lacks of twelve.
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
And with no less nobility of love
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Being a thing immortal as itself?
As thou art to thyself:
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Must render up myself.
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I have seen nothing.
And then it started like a guilty thing
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Is it not like the king?
Long live the king!
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Not a mouse stirring.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Writing
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Therefore I have entreated him along
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Believe so much in him, that he is young
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
Appears before them, and with solemn march
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Without the sensible and true avouch
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Is by a forged process of my death
And hears it roar beneath.
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
In faith,
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
For he himself is subject to his birth:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
What is between you? give me up the truth.
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
No, it is struck.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
And with a larger tether may he walk
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
In which the majesty of buried Denmark

The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To his own scandal.
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
All
Last night of all,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
He was a man, take him for all in all,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Farewell.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I am glad to see you well:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
It waves me still.
I will.
What is't, my lord? we will.
I warrant it will.
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
O, wonderful!
The inward service of the mind and soul
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
[Within]	Heaven secure him!
And will not let belief take hold of him
A piece of him.
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Nay, let's follow him.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
And to the manner born, it is a custom
Is it a custom?
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
In filial obligation for some term
Together with that fair and warlike form
And there assume some other horrible form,
SCENE IV. The platform.
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
O most pernicious woman!
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
What we have two nights seen.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Come hither, gentlemen,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
I shall not look upon his like again.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Without more motive, into every brain
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
To his confine: and of the truth herein
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Such was the very armour he had on
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
In honourable fashion.
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
This present object made probation.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
To show my duty in your coronation,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Look, with what courteous action
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
So horridly to shake our disposition
Shall in the general censure take corruption
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
For what we know must be and is as common
Ay, madam, it is common.
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
To put an antic disposition on,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
My custom always of the afternoon,
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
If it assume my noble father's person,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Well, sit we down,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
Now wears his crown.
As if increase of appetite had grown
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Bernardo?
Holla! Bernardo!
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
As infinite as man may undergo--
Be ruled; you shall not go.
Saw? who?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
Question it, Horatio.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
His beard was grizzled--no?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
No more but so?
I would not hear your enemy say so,
It would be spoke to.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
Hail to your lordship!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Why, what should be the fear?
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
For God's love, let me hear.
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
Consent to swear.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Murder!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Longer, longer.
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
My lord, the king your father.
To give these mourning duties to your father:
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
The king my father!
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
May give his saying deed; which is no further
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
Giving to you no further personal power
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
It is a nipping and an eager air.
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
You come most carefully upon your hour.
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
Our duty to your honour.
And in the porches of my ears did pour
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Hold off your hands.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
Importing the surrender of those lands
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Of mine own eyes.
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
But where was this?
To tell us this.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
No, by no means.
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
And let us once again assail your ears,
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
That was and is the question of these wars.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
It lifted up its head and did address
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
For your desire to know what is between us,
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Cock crows
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
What?
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Do you doubt that?
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
The leperous distilment; whose effect
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
But you'll be secret?
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
Well, good night.
Give you good night.
Give you good night.
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Hold you the watch to-night?
I will watch to-night;
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And vanish'd from our sight.
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Marry, well bethought:
But answer made it none: yet once methought
So be it!
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And draw you into madness? think of it:
To let you know of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
But do not go with it.
It beckons you to go away with it,
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
No; you'll reveal it.
Good my lord, tell it.
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Did you not speak to it?
I am thy father's spirit,
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Heaven will direct it.
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
It will not speak; then I will follow it.

O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
What think you on't?
I have sworn 't.
Exeunt

No reckoning made, but sent to my account
O, fear me not.
My lord, we will not.
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
In what particular thought to work I know not;
My lord, from head to foot.
I find thee apt;
The head is not more native to the heart,
And I am sick at heart.
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
Nay, but swear't.
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
To make it truster of your own report
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
By laboursome petition, and at last
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
Give me one poor request.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
Ay, marry, is't:

Alas, poor ghost!
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
My fate cries out,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
Not when I saw't.
Who hath relieved you?
It would have much amazed you.
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
But let me hear from you.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
What I have said to you.
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
This marvel to you.
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
I'll visit you.
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
Arm'd, say you?
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
But I have that within which passeth show;
Not of that dye which their investments show,
Of these delated articles allow.
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
What hour now?

That it went hand in hand even with the vow
Say,
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
And it must follow, as the night the day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,

Look you, I'll go pray.

See, it stalks away!

Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And these few precepts in thy memory
Yea, from the table of my memory
That are so fortified against our story
