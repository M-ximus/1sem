ACT I
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
A double blessing is a double grace,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Against the which, a moiety competent
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Alas, poor ghost!
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
All
All my smooth body.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
And I am sick at heart.
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And carriage of the article design'd,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And each particular hair to stand on end,
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
And hears it roar beneath.
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes each petty artery in this body
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And prey on garbage.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And recks not his own rede.
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
And then it started like a guilty thing
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And there assume some other horrible form,
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they in France of the best rank and station
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
And vanish'd from our sight.
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And will not let belief take hold of him
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And with no less nobility of love
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
A piece of him.
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Arm'd, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,

As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
A sable silver'd.
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
As he in his particular act and place
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
As if increase of appetite had grown
As if it some impartment did desire
As infinite as man may undergo--
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
As thou art to thyself:
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Ay, marry, is't:
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat

Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Before my God, I might not this believe
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Believe so much in him, that he is young
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
Bernardo?
Bernardo has my place.
Be ruled; you shall not go.
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
But I have that within which passeth show;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But do not go with it.
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But he's an arrant knave.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
But let me hear from you.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But this eternal blazon must not be
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
But to my mind, though I am native here
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
But where was this?
But you'll be secret?
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
By laboursome petition, and at last
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Cock crows
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Come hither, gentlemen,
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Consent to swear.
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Did you not speak to it?
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Do, if it will not stand.
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Do not, my lord.
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Do you doubt that?

Farewell.
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
For God's love, let me hear.
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
For every man has business and desire,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For he himself is subject to his birth:
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
For they are actions that a man might play:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
For what we know must be and is as common
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
For your desire to know what is between us,
Friends to this ground.
From me, whose love was of that dignity
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
From top to toe?

Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Giving to you no further personal power
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Good my lord, tell it.
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Go on; I'll follow thee.
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,

Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Hail to your lordship!
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
He.
Heaven will direct it.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
His beard was grizzled--no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Hold off your hands.
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holla! Bernardo!
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
How is't, my noble lord?
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
I am glad to see you well:
I am thy father's spirit,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I find thee apt;
If it assume my noble father's person,
If it be,
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
If there be any good thing to be done,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
I have seen nothing.
I have sworn 't.
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll visit you.
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Importing the surrender of those lands
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
In faith,
In filial obligation for some term
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In honourable fashion.
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
In obstinate condolement is a course
In that and all things will we show our duty.
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
In what particular thought to work I know not;
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Is by a forged process of my death
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
Is it a custom?
Is it not like the king?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Is the main motive of our preparations,
It beckons you to go away with it,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
It is a nipping and an eager air.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
It is offended.
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
It waves me still.
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
It would be spoke to.
It would have much amazed you.
I warrant it will.
I will.
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I will watch to-night;
I would I had been there.
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,

Last night of all,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
Longer, longer.
Long live the king!
Look, my lord, it comes!
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Look, with what courteous action
Look you, I'll go pray.
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,

Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
Mark me.
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Marry, well bethought:
May give his saying deed; which is no further
May sweep to my revenge.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Most constantly.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Murder!
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
Must render up myself.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My dread lord,
My fate cries out,
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
My good lord--
My hour is almost come,
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My lord, I did;
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
My lord, not I.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My lord, we will not.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Nay, but swear't.
Nay, let's follow him.
Nay, very pale.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
No, by no means.
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
No, it is struck.
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
No more but so?
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor I, my lord.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Not a mouse stirring.
Not of that dye which their investments show,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Not when I saw't.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Now wears his crown.
No; you'll reveal it.
O God!
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!

O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
O, fear me not.
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Of his affection to me.
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Of mine own eyes.
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Of these delated articles allow.
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O most pernicious woman!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Our duty to your honour.
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O, wonderful!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Pale or red?
Passing through nature to eternity.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
Propose the oath, my lord.

Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,

Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

Saw? who?
Say,
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Season your admiration for awhile
See, it stalks away!
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Shakespeare homepage | Hamlet | Entire play
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
Sit down awhile;
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
So be it!
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
So horridly to shake our disposition
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Such was the very armour he had on
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
That are so fortified against our story
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That can I;
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That if again this apparition come,
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That youth and observation copied there;
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!

The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
The bell then beating one,--
The better to beguile. This is for all:
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The head is not more native to the heart,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
The king my father!
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The lists and full proportions, are all made
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
Then saw you not his face?
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Therefore I have entreated him along
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
There's no offence, my lord.
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The safety and health of this whole state;
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
The source of this our watch and the chief head
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
The triumph of his pledge.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Think it no more;
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This marvel to you.
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This present object made probation.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'Tis gone!
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
'Tis strange.
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
'Tis very strange.
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To business with the king, more than the scope
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form
To give these mourning duties to your father:
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To offer it the show of violence;
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
To put an antic disposition on,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
To show my duty in your coronation,
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
To tell us this.
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To those of mine!
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
To what I shall unfold.
To you alone.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon my sword.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Well, good night.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Well, sit we down,
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
What?
What I have said to you.
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
What does this mean, my lord?
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
What hour now?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
What, is Horatio there?
What is between you? give me up the truth.
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
What is't, my lord? we will.
What, look'd he frowningly?
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What news, my lord?
What think you on't?
What we have two nights seen.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Where, my lord?
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Who hath relieved you?
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Who is't that can inform me?
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Who's there?
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Why, what should be the fear?
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
With all my imperfections on my head:
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
[Within]	Heaven secure him!
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Within the book and volume of my brain,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without the sensible and true avouch
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
Writing
Yea, from the table of my memory
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Yes, 'faith heartily.
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
You are the most immediate to our throne;
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You do not understand yourself so clearly
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
You shall not go, my lord.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
truepenny?
